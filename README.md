# Project Documentation

## Introduction

This project contains the Autograsper toolkit and involves automation of robotic stacking tasks using a CloudGripper robot. Includes robot control and data collection. Currently containing stacking task example but can generalize to many manipulation tasks.

An **example dataset** collected using Autograsper containing over 200 episodes of stacking and destacking can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bMfuvOPSTdM5wds8X5l6HQblZtYpMHCh/view?usp=sharing).

### **Featuring:**

- **utils**: a set of general functions intended for any project.
- **autograsper**: an example of scheduling a loop of stacking tasks, can be used as template for robot control.
- **recorder**: a class that records all robot data during tasks and stores it in a clear and structured way.
- **thread_manager**: an example of using all above to perform and record a large number of robot tasks.

## Modules Overview

### utils.py

The utils module provides a set of standard functions intented to be useful with any project

### thread_manager.py

#### Functions

- `get_new_session_id(base_dir)`: Generates a new session ID based on existing directories.
- `run_autograsper(autograsper)`: Runs the autograsper process.
- `setup_recorder(output_dir, robot_idx)`: Sets up the recorder with given parameters.
- `run_recorder(recorder)`: Runs the recorder process.
- `state_monitor(autograsper)`: Monitors the state of the autograsper.

#### Main Execution

- Sets up command-line argument parsing and initializes the `Autograsper` and `Recorder` instances to run in parallel. It monitors their states and manages session directories.

# Usage Guide

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

#### 1.A: Setup virtual environment and install dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. 
Create a virtual environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
```
Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 1.B: CloudGripper API
Clone the [CloudGripper API repo](https://github.com/cloudgripper/cloudgripper-api), place the Autograsper code in that directory. Move the `utils.py` and `rgb_object_tracker.py` file to the `library` directory.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

The code requires an environment variable `ROBOT_TOKEN` to authenticate with the GripperRobot API. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```env
ROBOT_TOKEN=your_robot_token_here
```

## Running the Code

### Running the Autograsper

The `autograsper.py` script is controls the robot to perform stacking tasks. Can be used as a template for scheduled robot control.

1. **Command-Line Arguments**:

   - `--robot_idx`: The index of the robot to be controlled.
   - `--output_dir`: The directory to save state data.

2. **Example Command**:

   ```sh
   python Autograsper/autograsper.py --robot_idx 1 --output_dir /path/to/output
   ```

3. **Description**:
   - Initializes the `Autograsper` class.
   - Runs the main grasping loop, where the robot performs a series of tasks such as moving, gripping, and placing objects.
   - Saves the state of the robot after each action for later analysis.

### Recording the Robot's Actions

The `recorder.py` script records the robot's actions, capturing both top and bottom camera views.

1. **Command-Line Arguments**:

   - `--robot_idx`: The index of the robot to be recorded.
   - `--output_dir`: The directory to save recorded videos and final images.

2. **Example Command**:

   ```sh
   python Autograsper/recorder.py --robot_idx 1 --output_dir /path/to/output
   ```

3. **Description**:
   - Initializes the `Recorder` class.
   - Records the robot's actions, saving video files at specified intervals.
   - Displays the bottom camera view and waits for user input to stop recording.

### Example: Collecting Data for Stacking

The `thread_manager.py` script combines the functionality of `autograsper.py` and `recorder.py` to automate data collection for stacking tasks.

1. **Command-Line Arguments**:

   - `--robot_idx`: The index of the robot to be controlled and recorded.

2. **Example Command**:

   ```sh
   python Autograsper/thread_manager.py --robot_idx 1
   ```

3. **Description**:
   - Initializes the `Autograsper` and `Recorder` classes.
   - Runs the autograsper and recorder in parallel threads.
   - Monitors the state of the autograsper and manages recording sessions based on the robot's activity state.
   - Creates new data points and organizes the output into structured directories.

#### Detailed Workflow

1. **Initialization**:

   - The `Autograsper` initializes with command-line arguments, setting up the robot and its parameters.
   - The `Recorder` initializes with a session ID, output directory, camera calibration parameters, and robot token.

2. **Running the Autograsper**:

   - The autograsper performs a series of actions such as moving to specific coordinates, opening and closing the gripper, and stacking objects.
   - Each action's state is saved for later analysis.

3. **Recording Sessions**:

   - The recorder captures video frames from the robot's cameras.
   - Videos are saved in the specified output directory.
   - The bottom camera view is displayed for real-time monitoring.

4. **State Monitoring**:
   - The `thread_manager.py` script monitors the autograsper's state.
   - When the robot's state changes, the script handles the transition, creating new data points and managing recording sessions accordingly.
   - The script ensures that recording continues seamlessly through state changes, such as resetting or completing tasks.
